## Introduction
Roulette Reader uses Google Books API to generate a list of 10 suggestions based on the keyword entered. Users can select books from the list generated and save them in a carousel, and cycle through them when looking for a title to read. Users can also "spin the wheel" and generate a random list of suggestions if they're in the mood to take a chance.

## Technologies
